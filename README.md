Welcome to the E-Commerce Shop project! This is a React TypeScript application built with Chakra UI, designed to provide a simple online shopping experience. We fetch product data from the FakeStore API to simulate a real e-commerce store.

You can also see the deployed project [here](https://ecommerce-shop-red.vercel.app/ "here").

Key Features:

- Product Catalog: Browse through a wide range of products, each with detailed information including title, description, price, and image.
- Product Details: Click on a product to view its detailed information, including product description and price.
- Shopping Cart: Add products to your shopping cart and see a summary of your selected items.
- Checkout: Review the items in your cart and proceed to the checkout process.
- Responsive Design: Our user interface is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes for a seamless shopping experience.
- TypeScript: We use TypeScript to ensure type safety and enhance the development process.
